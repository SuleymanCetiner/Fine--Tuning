# Fine - Tuning & Transfer Learning 

Here, we use advanced methods like Fine Tuning & Trasnfer Learning.
This is a hybrid project where TENSORFLOW AND KERAS libraries are used at the same time.
So this makes it unique.


Basically, Transfer Learning means you add some layers to top of the model and
Fine Tuning means to continue training by unfreezing top layers.

At this project, i used horse & humans dataset.

My dataset and model are different from original source.

Original source is : https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/transfer_learning

I changed lots of things and trained a little bit.You can train more if you want. 
By the way, i interrupt training at the second epoch in intention to show that it works.
