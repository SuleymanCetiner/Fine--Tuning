# Fine - Tuning & Transfer Learning 

Here, we use advanced methods like Fine Tuning & Trasnfer Learning.

Basically, Transfer Learning means you add some layers to top of the model and
Fine Tuning means to continue training by unfreezing top layers.

At this project, i used horse & humans dataset.

My dataset and model are different from original source.

Original source is : https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/transfer_learning

I changed lots of things and trained a little bit.You can train more if you want.

By the way, i interrupt training at the second epoch in intention to show that it works
So you can use this model for yourself.
